# **Assignment #2: Understanding the Requirements**

## **Current Two Requirements**

### **Requirement 1: Organizing Training Data**
**As a developer, I want to organize training questions separately from answers so that I can manage training data efficiently.**

#### Assumptions & Validation:
- **Assumption:** Developers want an easy way to organize training data.
- **Validation:** Conduct interviews with developers to confirm their data organization preferences.

#### **Preliminary Tasks:**
- Create a system that enables questions and answers to be stored separately.
- Utilize the search and filter functions to make data retrieval simple.
- Create a user-friendly interface for data management and organization. 

#### **Outcome:**
- Developers can quickly find and categorize training data, improving efficiency and reducing errors.

### **Requirement 2: Checking for Bias in Training Data**
**As a developer, I want to ensure that the training data is balanced so that I can create fair and accurate AI models.**

#### **Assumptions & Validation:**
- **Assumption:** There are reliable tools that can help detect bias in AI training data.
- **Validation:** Test bias detection tools and get feedback from developers.

- **Assumption:** Balanced training data leads to better AI performance.
- **Validation:** Compare AI models trained with and without balanced data.

#### **Preliminary Tasks:**
- Investigate and incorporate AI technologies for detecting bias. 
- Put in place a warning system to draw attention to any biases.
- Create a manual review procedure for biases that have been reported. 

#### **Outcome:**
- AI models perform more fairly and accurately, avoiding biased decision-making.
